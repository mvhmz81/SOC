      <p> Englands football players bring it home with a feminine touch </p>
  
    
      <div id = "page"> 
        <p1> Old age rivalry has come to affront as England's lions came face to face with german warriors.  </p1> 
        <p2>Who will come out as winners, was the question of the night, which our ladies answered with penalty kicks and a successful win.
        </p2>
        <p3> the journey to this day has not been easy, with the female gender having to deal with alot of injustice.  In 1921 the FA banned women's football for 50 years in a hope to squash the new found joy of football in the "weaker sex!".  Instead this installed a new awakening of female aggression to fight for what was their right - equality.
       </p3>
        <p4>The change did not occur overnight and instead it was the will from generations of women who fought this cause, that led to the momentous win this year </p4>

          <h2> Heres a time line of this years journey </h2>
          <h3> Group stage</h3>
            <ul> 
          <li><strong> 1-0 </strong> Sweden</li>
            <li><strong> 8-0 </strong> Norway</li>
            <li><strong> 5-0 </strong> Northern Ireland</li>
            <h4> Quarter Finals</h4>
              <li><strong> 2-1 </strong> Spain</li>
              <h4> Semi Finals</h4>
              <li><strong> 4-0 </strong> Sweden</li>
              <h4> Finals</h4>
              <li><strong> 2-1 </strong> Germany</li>
            </ul>
      
            <p5>
              This tremendous achievement is hope fully only the beginning and will lead to many more momentous moments.  We already saw the viewership increase which will hopefully continue and further fund and support our winning ladies. What we hope to see less of is the big male centric football clubs refusing access to women's football - something they must be regretting now.  
            </p5>
            <p6>This writers finals thoughts are that this is not the time to just sit back and enjoy.  This journey needs to further develop to an era when there is no requirement for pages to promote a this feat.  To a point where it is the norm and no one is discriminated against for sex, skin-colour and the size of ones body</p6>
